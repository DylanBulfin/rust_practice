# rust_practice
Simple projects to help me learn rust

- tasklist: Simple task manager. ./tasklist --help (in same directory as binary) should hopefully be pretty straightforward
- filebrowser: Simple file browser repl, for now just a worse version of a shell that only supports file commands but if all goes well I'd eventually like to turn it into a TUI
